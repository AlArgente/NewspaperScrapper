# NewspaperScrapper

Project to extract title, text and images from newspapers.
Actually this script only works with ("Elpais")[https://elpais.com], but I will add
more newspapers in my free time.

The script will create a folder (if not exists) for the newspaper,
and then will multiple folders (one for each news). For each news
it will create a folder with all the images, a file with some metadata
(number of images, date from extraction, title), and one last file 
with the text from the news.
